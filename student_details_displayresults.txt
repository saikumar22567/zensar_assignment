2. Create a class called student which has data members like rollno, name, class, SEM, branch,int [] marks=new int marks [5](marks of 5 subjects )
-Write a method called displayresult, which should calculate the average marks
-If marks of any one subject is less than 35 print result as failed
-If marks of all subject is >35 but average is < 50 then also print result as failed
-If avg > 50 then print result as passed.
-Pass the details of student like rollno, name, class, SEM, branch in constructor
-Write a Display Data method to display all values.
