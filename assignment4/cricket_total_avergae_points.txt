Write a program to find the Sum and the Average points scored by the teams in the IPL. Create a Class called Cricket that 
has a function called Pointscalculation(int no_of_matches) that takes no.of matches as input and accepts that many scores
from the user. The function should then display the Average and Sum of the scores
